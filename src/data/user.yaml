    about: "By profession I'm Senior Data Analyst at Accenture. But my interests span a multitude of areas accross IT and Applications of IT in Finance. I have proficiency in Machine Learning, Personal Investment and Financial Engineering.

    Nowadays I'm curious about Front-end development and Multi-Platform Application development.

    I believe in clean coding and slick design. Building astonishing apps is my passion. Users demand cool products to use instead of sloppy ones, so I work with that purpose.
